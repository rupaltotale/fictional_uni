This project is a Website developed locally. 

This website is a Wordpress website with a custom theme made with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, and AJAX requests. 

It is a Fictional university website with post types such as Pages, Post, Programs, Events, Professors, and Campuses. Each post type has its own page template, archive template, and relationships with other post types. 

The website is dynamic i.e anytime new information is added, one need not tinker with the HTML or CSS or any code for the data to be accurately shown on the website. The code logic in the theme handles this.
